# PCB Designs & Schematics

## Overview
This repository is a collection of **original PCB designs, electronic schematics, and hardware system experiments** developed as part of ongoing work in **electronics, embedded systems, and telecommunications hardware**.

Each project in this repository is designed with a focus on **real-world engineering practices**, including component selection, signal integrity, manufacturability, and system reliability.

---

## Objectives
- Design and document practical electronic systems from concept to layout
- Build a verifiable hardware design portfolio
- Apply industry-standard PCB design workflows
- Experiment with scalable and production-aware circuit designs
- Maintain version-controlled hardware assets

---

## Tools & Software
- **Altium Designer** (Primary)
- **KiCad** (Selected projects)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Standard fabrication outputs (Gerbers, Drill, BOM)

---

## Design Philosophy
- **Functionality first** – designs must work in real hardware
- **Simplicity over complexity** – avoid overengineering
- **Manufacturability matters** – DRC, DFM, and BOM awareness
- **Revision-driven improvement** – designs evolve through testing

---

## Project Status
Projects may be in different stages:
- Concept
- Schematic Design
- PCB Layout
- Review & Optimization
- Fabrication & Testing

Each project folder includes its own documentation and design status.

---

## Use Cases
This repository serves as:
- A personal hardware engineering portfolio
- A reference for future product development
- A testbed for learning electronics, PCB design, and system integration

Unless stated otherwise, projects are **experimental** and not certified for commercial deployment.
